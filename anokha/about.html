	<h1>What is Anokha </h1>
	<p>When 4000 students from all over the country come together with one purpose, the results are not merely beneficial; they have the power to create lasting change.</p>

<p>For instance, fourteen teams of students participated in Innovate; in addition to prize money the winners also received an opportunity to actually implement their solutions.</p>

<p>The team that placed first proposed the development of vertical axis wind turbine farms on campus to reduce dependency on power consumption from the main grid.</p>

<p>Other winning teams proposed paper recycling machines and book banks of used books to be availed by needy students.</p>

<p>Innovate was only one of 50 competitive events at Anokha, the annual tech-fest of the Amrita School of Engineering at Coimbatore campus; winners took home prizes worth over Rs. 1.5 million.</p>

<p>Student participants had the opportunity to attend workshops and conferences, many of which were focused on sustainable development.</p>

<p>The Ecopreneur Challenge which was part of the Green I conference had student teams developing business plans for diverse eco-products such as waterless composting toilets and resource-efficient bricks.</p>

<p>“We want to encourage the technical talent available in the country to focus on environmentally-friendly solutions to problems we see all around us,” the student organizers shared.</p>

<p>Such a perspective was emphasized also by R. Venugopal, Vice-President, Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions, Coimbatore, as he spoke about technical developments that don’t damage the environment, during the inauguration.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget your core values,” said N. Saravanan, CEO, Nissan Ashok Leyland Technologies, Chennai, speaking to the participating students.</p>

<p>The Anokha team didn’t; even while the fest was going on, the students made sure that waste was collected from various spots on campus and sorted into plastic, paper and compostable items.</p>

<p>Also remembering their core values was the student team that put together a beautiful exhibition of articles made by Origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. The money collected at the exhibition was donated for charitable purposes.</p>

<p>Other popular events were the aero-modeling show featuring remote-controlled small aircrafts, the bike stunt show and an exclusive expo of vintage and new cars and bikes. The auto expo emphasized the need for driving safely.</p>

<p>On all three fest evenings, participants delighted in musical and dance performances by Amrita students and faculty.</p>
